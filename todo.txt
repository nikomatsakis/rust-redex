;; REDEX MODEL FOR RUST
;;
;; Current state:
;;
;; FIXME - Type system rules do not handle vectors well
;;
;; FIXME - Type system rules for match issue a loan for entire Option but
;;         in Real Rust we have this downcast notion so we can issue a more
;;         targeted loan; I don't think this makes any real difference in practice,
;;         so long as we are limited to Option loans.
;;
;; FIXME - Consider just removing by-ref match and instead having an operator
;;         to convert Option<T> to Option<&T>
;;
;; FIXME - check that local variables types are bounded by their lifetime
;;
;; FIXME - add in relationships between lifetime parameters that we can infer from types
